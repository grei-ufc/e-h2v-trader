## PySP Overview
PySP is an extension to the [Pyomo](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo)
optimization modeling package for formulating and solving stochastic
programming optimization problems.

PySP was originally developed within the Pyomo project and has
subsequently been replaced by
[mpi-sppy](https://github.com/Pyomo/mpi-sppy)
as the recommended extension for optimization under uncertainty in Pyomo.

We plan to make PySP available at least until some time in 2023.

### Developers

PySP was split out of the main Pyomo repository in February,
2021. Developer discussions continue to occur through the main Pyomo
developer mailing list hosted on [google
groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyomo-developers).
